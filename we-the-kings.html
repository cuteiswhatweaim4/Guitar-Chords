[Intro]
C G Am F

[Verse 1]
C
Check yes Juliet
G
Are you with me?
Am
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
F
I won't go until you come outside
C
Check yes Juliet
G
Kill the limbo
Am
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
F
There's no turning back for us tonight

[Chorus]
C
Lace up your shoes
G
Ayo ayo
Am
Here's how we do

[Chorus]
C
Run baby run
G
Don't ever look back
Am
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
F
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
C
Run baby run, forever we'll be
G
You and me

[Verse 2]
C
Check yes Juliet
G
I'll be waiting
Am
Wishing, wanting yours for the taking
F
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul goodbye
C
Check yes Juliet
G
Here's the countdown:
Am
3, 2, 1, now fall in my arms now
F
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind

[Chorus]
C
Lace up your shoes
G
Ayo ayo
Am
Here's how we do

[Chorus]
C
Run baby run
G
Don't ever look back
Am
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
F
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
C
Run baby run, forever we'll be
G
You and me

[Bridge]
C
We're flying through the night
G
We're flying through the night
Am
Way up high
F
The view from here is getting better with you
C
By my side

[Chorus]
C
Run baby run
G
Don't ever look back
Am
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
F
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
C
Run baby run, forever will be

[Outro]
C
Run baby run
G
Don't ever look back
Am
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
F
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
C
Run baby run, forever will be
G
You and me
C
You and me
G
You and me
