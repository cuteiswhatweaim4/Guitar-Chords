                    <pre>
Capo 1st fret
 
 
D        G         D
 She fell to the bottom of her life
      A
This wasn't meant for two
D          G        D
 She struggles to find herself in time
      A
But she can barely move


Pre-Chorus:

   D
Just try and get up
     G
You gotta slowly brush off
      D
I know that words aren't enough
       A
But you're better than this


Chorus:

D
 Save your heart
  G          D
For someone that's worth dying for
   A
Don't give it away
D
 Torn apart,
   G            D
Never getting what you've been crying for
   A
It's always the same


Verse 2:

D       G      D
 She turns the pages everyday
     A
Just to change the mood
D       G        D
 But every chapter reads the same
      A
So hard to make it through


Pre-Chorus:

   D
Just try and get up
     G
You gotta slowly brush off
      D
I know that words aren't enough
       A
But you're better than this


Chorus:

D
 Save your heart
  G          D
For someone that's worth dying for
   A
Don't give it away
D
 Torn apart,
   G            D
Never getting what you've been crying for
   A
It's always the same


Chorus Part 2:

     G
And you give (and you give)
     D
And they take (and they take)
      G
And it's love that you want
     A
But not love that you make


Chorus:

D
 Save your heart
  G           D
For someone that's worth dying for
    A
Don't give it away


Bridge:

D
 Save your heart
      G
For someone who leaves you breathless
   D
And I know that you're scared
      A
Seems like someone said you had it in you
D            G
 All along you said you knew this was wrong
        D      A
But still worth dying for

D
 Save your heart
      G
For someone who leaves you breathless
   D
And I know that you're scared
      A
Seems like someone said you had it in you
D            G
 All along you said you knew this was wrong
        D      A
But still worth dying for


Chorus Part 2:

     G
And you give (and you give)
     D
And they take (and they take)
      G
And it's love that you want
     A
But not love that you make


Ending:

D
 Save your heart
  G           D
For someone that's worth dying for
   A
Don't give it away
   A     D
Don't give it away

[Intro]
Bm     G     D    A

[Verse 1]
Bm
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
G
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
D
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
A
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
