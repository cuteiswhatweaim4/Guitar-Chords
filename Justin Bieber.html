Capo 3rd fret
 
 
[Verse 1]
G             G/B                         C
  Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
                  G
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
G                  G/B                         C
  What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
                G
Do you think of me?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
         G         Em             C       G
When you close your eyes, tell me what are you dreamin'?
     G        Em                C   G
Everything, I -- wanna know it all, mmm
 
 
[Chorus 1]
          G            Em        C            G
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
      G              Em                  C              G
Oh if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
      G           Em             C         G
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
        G            Em           C          G
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
           G        Em       C        G
I'm gonna love you (oooh ooh-oooh ooh-ooh)
 
 
[Verse 2]
G             G/B                       C
  Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
                 G
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
G                G/B                C
  When you think about your forever now
                G
Do you think of me?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
         G         Em             C       G
When you close your eyes, tell me what are you dreamin'?
     G        Em                C   G
Everything, I -- wanna know it all---
 
 
[Chorus 2]
          G            Em        C            G
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
      G              Em                  C              G
Oh if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
      G           Em             C         G
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
        G            Em           C          G
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
           G        Em       C        G
I'm gonna love you (oooh ooh-oooh ooh-ooh)
           G        Em       C        G
I'm gonna love you (oooh ooh-oooh ooh-ooh)
 
 
[Bridge]
Bm               C
   Ooh, want the good and the bad, everything in between
Bm            C
   Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
N.C.
Ooh, yeah
 
 
[Chorus 3]
          G            Em        C            G
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
      G              Em                  C              G
Oh if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours (sweet heart of yours)
      G           Em             C         G
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try (yeah)
        G            Em           C          G
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
           G        Em       C        G
I'm gonna love you (oooh ooh-oooh ooh-ooh)
           G        Em       C               G
I'm gonna love you (oooh ooh-oooh) yeah (ooh-ooh)
 
 
[Outro]
      G              Em                         (C)
And I-- (do you love the rain, does it make you dance?)
C         G                       (G)
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
 G  Em   C              G
I-----,  I'm gonna love you

Capo 4th Fret

[Verse 1]
 
            C              G/B          Am
For all the times that you rain on my parade
            Dm               C        G/B
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              C                  G/B         Am
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              Dm            C           G/B
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
                   C           G/B                  Am
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Dm        C                G/B
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 C        G/B              Am
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Dm         C                G/B
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
              Am           F              C
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Am      F                C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Am          F               C                G
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Am  F            G
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        C                 F        C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
C                 F        C
You should go and love yourself
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
             C                G/B      Am
But when you told me that you hated my friends
         Dm               C           G/B
The only problem was with you and not them
          C             G/B            Am
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             Dm             C            G/B
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                   C           G/B                  Am
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Dm        C                G/B
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 C        G/B              Am
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Dm         C                G/B
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
              Am           F              C
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Am      F                C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Am          F               C                G
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Am  F            G
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        C                 F        C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself

[Verse 3]
 
            C              G/B          Am
For all the times that you made me feel small
          Dm               C          G/B
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
        C                G/B          Am
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
        Dm              C             G/B
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        C                 F        C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
C                 F        C
You should go and love yourself

Cause if you like the way you look that much

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
