[Verse 1]
 
            C              G/B          Am
For all the times that you rain on my parade
            Dm               C        G/B
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              C                  G/B         Am
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              Dm            C           G/B
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
                   C           G/B                  Am
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Dm        C                G/B
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 C        G/B              Am
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Dm         C                G/B
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
              Am           F              C
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Am      F                C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Am          F               C                G
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Am  F            G
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        C                 F        C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
C                 F        C
You should go and love yourself
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
             C                G/B      Am
But when you told me that you hated my friends
         Dm               C           G/B
The only problem was with you and not them
          C             G/B            Am
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             Dm             C            G/B
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                   C           G/B                  Am
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Dm        C                G/B
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 C        G/B              Am
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Dm         C                G/B
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
              Am           F              C
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Am      F                C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Am          F               C                G
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Am  F            G
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        C                 F        C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself

[Verse 3]
 
            C              G/B          Am
For all the times that you made me feel small
          Dm               C          G/B
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
        C                G/B          Am
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
        Dm              C             G/B
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

[Capo 2]

[Intro]
G D A
G D A

[Verse 1]
D A Bm G
You and I were like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky.
D A
With you I'm alive
Bm G
like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide
G A
So stop time right here in the moonlight
Bm C
'cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

[Chorus]
G D A
Without you, I feel broke like I'm half of a whole
G D A
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
G D A Bm A G
Without you, I feel torn, like a sail in a storm
A G D A
Without you I'm just a sad song
G D A
I'm just a sad song

[Verse 2]
D A Bm G
With you I fall it's like I'm leaving all my past and silhouettes upon the wall
D A
With you I'm a beautiful mess
Bm G
it's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears upon the edge
G A
So stop time right here in the moonlight
Bm C
'cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

[Chorus]
G D A
Without you, I feel broke like I'm half of a whole
G D A
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
G D A Bm A G
Without you, I feel torn, like a sail in a storm
A
Without you I'm just a sad song

[Bridge]
F#m G D A
You're the perfect melody, the only harmony I wanna hear
F#m G D
You're my favorite part of me, with you standing next to me I've got nothing
A
to fear

[Chorus]
G D A
Without you, I feel broke like I'm half of a whole
G D A
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
G D F# Bm A G
Without you, I feel torn, like a sail in a storm
A
Without you I'm just a sad song

[Outro]
G D A
I'm just a sad song
